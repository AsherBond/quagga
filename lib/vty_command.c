/*==============================================================================
 * vty_command.c contains functions used by the command processing, where
 * that interacts with the vty -- in particular vty I/O.
 *
 * There are three command loops -- cmd_read_config(), cq_process() and
 * vty_vtysh_command_loop().  Each command loop appears to be a thread of
 * control sucking in command lines, parsing and executing them.  In the
 * process, input and output pipes are opened and closed, and the vty stack
 * grows and shrinks.
 *
 * For cmd_read_config() -- see command_execute.c -- the command loop is,
 * indeed, a thread of control and all the I/O operations are "blocking", so
 * that any waiting required is done inside the loop.
 *
 * For cq_process() -- see command_queue.c -- things are a lot more
 * complicated: first, I/O is non-blocking, so I/O operations may return
 * CMD_WAITING and the command loop must exit and be able to restart, when
 * the I/O completes in the background; second, in a multi-pthread environment
 * some operations must be performed in the CLI pthread while others must be
 * performed in the command (the Routing Engine, generally) pthread.  (It would
 * be easier if each cq_process instance were a separate pthread, but we here
 * implement it as a form of co-routine, driven by messages.)
 *
 * For vty_vtysh_command_loop() -- see vty_vtysh.c -- the command loop is,
 * indeed, a thread of control and all the I/O operations are "blocking", so
 * that any waiting required is done inside the loop.
 *
 * The I/O is structured so that all output is buffered.  When output is
 * "pushed" an attempt will be made to empty the buffers, but the operation
 * will not block.  When an output is closed, the close operation will keep
 * pushing (blocking as required) until all buffers are empty, and only then
 * will the close complete.  Command line fetch for the base level input
 * may wait for all output to complete before proceeding.
 *
 * Generally all commands output only to the output buffer.  Only when the
 * command finishes will the output be "pushed", and at that point it may be
 * discarded (for example, when reading configuration file).
 *
 * So a command loop takes the general form:
 *
 *   loop:   fetch command line             -- break if nothing, fail or cancel
 *           parse command line             -- loop if empty or all comment
 *                                          -- break if parsing fails
 *           reflect command line           -- break if fail or cancel
 *           do any pipe open actions       -- break if fail or cancel
 *           dispatch command (if any)
 *           complete command               -- break if any command error
 *           push command output to output  -- break if fail or cancel
 *             -- loop
 *
 *   hiatus: deal with issue(s) (may loop)
 *             -- return to loop if OK and not waiting for input
 *           exit command loop
 *
 * In the loop, if any operation receives a return code it cannot immediately
 * deal with, it breaks out to the "hiatus".  Once the issue is dealt with, can
 * leave the hiatus and return to the top of the loop.
 *
 * Note that in hiatus the command loop may be waiting for some output I/O
 * to complete -- e.g. while closing an output pipe.
 *
 * So, most obviously for cq_process(), the loop is a co-routine which exits
 * and is re-entered at the hiatus.  When the loop does exit, it has either
 * come to a dead stop (for a number of reasons) or it is waiting for input.
 *
 * The state of the command loop is vty->vio->cl_state.  The main states are:
 *
 *   vcl_cq_running   -- somewhere in the "cq" command loop, doing things.
 *
 *   vcl_cq_waiting   -- waiting for I/O in the "cq" command loop
 *
 *   vcl_running      -- somewhere in the config reading command loop
 *
 * When some event (such as some input arriving) occurs it is signalled to
 * the command loop by uty_cmd_signal(), where the value of the signal is
 * a CMD_XXXX code.  If the loop is in vcl_cq_waiting state, the loop can be
 * re-entered (at the hiatus point) with the return code.  Otherwise, what
 * happens depends on the state and the return code -- see uty_cmd_signal().
 *
 * Functions called by the various steps in the command loop will check for
 * a pending signal, and will force a jump to hiatus.  (This is how the command
 * loop may be "interrupted" by, for example an I/O error detected in the
 * pselect() process.)

 * Authentication of vty
 *
 * Note that if the AUTH_NODE password fails too many times, the vty is
 * closed.
 *
 * Quagga authentication is a touch complicated.  The following appear to be
 * the rules:
 *
 *   1. host.no_password_check -- set by "no login" command
 *
 *      Means that a VTY_TERMINAL can start without going through any
 *      password check -- whether or not a host.password is configured.
 *
 *      Note that this does not affect the authentication for enable, except
 *      at startup of a VTY_TERMINAL, in which case:
 *
 *        * if host.restricted_mode -> RESTRICTED_NODE
 *
 *        * else if host.advanced   -> ENABLE_NODE
 *
 *          This is whether or not an enable password exists.
 *
 *        * otherwise               -> VIEW_NODE
 *
 *      So being in RESTRICTED_NODE <=> was host.no_password_check &&
 *      host.restricted_mode *when* the VTY_TERMINAL was started.
 *
 *   2. host.restricted_mode  -- set by "anonymous restricted"
 *
 *      Significant only at VTY_TERMINAL start, and only if no_password_check.
 *
 *      NB: if the enable password is NULL, there is not much point in
 *          RESTRICTED_NODE, since ENABLE_NODE is but one command away.
 *
 *      NB: that behaviour is is modified here... if is in RESTRICTED_MODE,
 *          will not authenticate AUTH_ENABLE_NODE if there is no enable
 *          password.
 *
 *          Note that the check is left to this point, so that is completed
 *          atomically.  Elsewhere, will refuse to enter ENABLE_NODE from
 *          RESTRICTED_NODE if no enable password.  By the time we get here
 *          it is (just) possible that the situation has changed.
 *
 *   3. host.advanced  -- set by "service advanced-vty"
 *
 *      Significant iff there is no enable password, when it sets ENABLE_NODE
 *      as the start up node (if no_password_check) or post AUTH_NODE node.
 *
 *   4. host.password  -- set by "password xx"
 *
 *      Unless no_password_check, if there is no password, you cannot start
 *      a vty.
 *
 *   5. host.enable  -- set by "enable password xx"
 *
 *      If this is set, then must authenticate against it for vty to reach
 *      ENABLE_NODE.
 *
 *      If it is not set, then can enter ENABLE_NODE at any time.
 *
 * If AUTH_ENABLE_NODE fails, falls back to the node we came from -- which has
 * been planted in the context for this purpose.  (If host.restricted_mode has
 * changed since the vty started, could argue this should change where should
 * fall back to... but that seems unnecessarily complicated.)
 *
 * For AUTH_ENABLE_NODE, when succeeds may try to go to CONFIG_NODE -- will
 * try to get gain the symbol of power here, but if cannot, will go to
 * ENABLE_NODE and issue a warning message.
 *
 * Note that we expect:
 *
 *   vty->node       -- current node: AUTH_NODE or AUTH_ENABLE_NODE
 *
 * And, if AUTH_ENABLE_NODE:
 *
 *   context->tnode  -- target node: ENABLE_NODE or CONFIG_NODE
 *   context->onode  -- node before: VIEW_NODE or RESTRICTED_NODE
 *                      returns to that node on too many password failures
 *
 * Returns: CMD_SUCCESS  -- OK, one way or another
 *          CMD_WARNING  -- password failure or could not get to CONFIG_NODE
 *          CMD_ERROR    -- too many password failures
 *
 *          If not CMD_SUCCESS, message sent to vty as required.
 *
 * NB: whatever the return code, returns the node to use next (may be the
 *     same as the current node).
 *
 *     This is unlike ordinary commands, where the node can only change on
 *     CMD_SUCCESS.  Furthermore, the change may be to one of a number of
 *     nodes -- not just to one, pre-ordained node.

   * returned, and the command loop will loop round to fetch the next command
   * line, *unless* we are waiting for some *input* to arrive first.  The
   * vin_waiting flag is set iff the vin is non-blocking, and the vin is
   * waiting for input.
   *
   * If the vin_waiting flag is set I/O handling *will* uty_cmd_signal() when
   * there is some input.  A flag is used because for VIN_TERM/VOUT_TERM the
   * position is a little complicated.  In particular, changes on the output
   * side may affect whether is waiting in the CLI.
   *
   * If comes out of the hiatus with CMD_SUCCESS or CMD_WAITING, loop back
   * into the hiatus if some signal has been set in the meantime.
   *
   * There are two bad things that can happen:
   *
   *   1) leaves here with CMD_WAITING but no timer or read ready or write
   *      ready is actually going to wake us up again.
   *
   *      This would be (obviously) a bug, but the worst that happens is that
   *      a vty of whatever sort hangs.
   *
   *      However... if this happens repeatedly, then may eventually run out
   *      of file handles...   TODO some limit on vty file handles ??
   *
   *   2) leaves here with CMD_SUCCESS, but the read side has nothing to
   *      offer, so end up here again... and we enter a screaming loop.
   *
   *      This is a BAD bug, because the CLI locks up, eating CPU and generally
   *      looking like a complete twonk.
   *
   *      The vin_wedged field is:
   *
   *        * zeroised when a vin is created
   *
   *        * zeroised each time arrives here with ret != CMD_WAITING.

   *
   *     The uty_vio_execpetion() mechanism stops vin and vout, setting them
   *     !vin_active or !vout_active.  Hitting eof on an input will set it

   *
   *     Closing the vin and vout in step with each other, is required and has
   *     some impact on the restoration of context, particularly
   *     vout->out_ordinary. Note that where vin_depth == vout_depth, we close
   *     the vin first.

   *       stderr return, etc have been dealt with, below.
   *
   *       If we are cancelling, will discard everything (if not vout_base).
   *
   *       Otherwise, the pop will push any remaining output and any remaining
   *       pipe return is shovelled through, and any child process is
   *       collected, along with its termination condition.

   *       later to complete the operation.
   *
   *     For a vin:
   *
   *       The close will immediately close the input, and discard anything
   *       which has been buffered.  The only difficulty with closing inputs
   *       is VIN_PIPE, where the "return" input (from the child stderr) may
   *       not yet have finished, and we may wish to drain the input before
   *       closing it.
   *
   *       For blocking vio, close operations will either complete or fail.
   *
   *       For non-blocking vio, close operations may return CMD_WAITING
   *       (eg: VIN_PIPE where the child stderr is not yet at EOF, or the
   *       child completion status has not yet been collected).
   *
   *       Where a close does not succeed, exit here and expect to come back
   *       later to complete the operation.
   *
   *    NB: in the event of I/O errors or such during uty_vin_pop() or
   *        uty_vout_pop(), more vin/vout may be stopped.  If an error affects
   *        the vout_base, then may find vst_final becomes set.
   *
   *        We expect a CMD_IO_ERROR return in these cases, which exits
   *        expecting to return here if not vst_final.  However, if not then

 * Error handling
 */

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Dealing with error of some kind.
 *
 * In general any error causes the vin/vout stack to be closed either
 * completely or down to the base vin/vout.  vio->err_depth contains the
 * default depth to close back to.  An I/O error in either vin_base or
 * vout_base will set the err_depth to 0.
 *
 * The vio->ebuf contains all error messages collected so far for the vio,
 * and will be output to the vout_base when the stack has been closed to
 * that point.  The vio->ebuf will then be emptied.
 *
 * Sets the sh_serv_ret, unless not stopping on CMD_WARNING.
 *
 * For command and parser errors:
 *
 *   The current vio->obuf will have an end_mark.  After the end_mark will be
 *   any output generated since the start of the current command (or any
 *   out_push since then).  For command errors, that output is expected to be
 *   messages associated with the error.
 *
 *   The location of the error is written to the vio->ebuf, and then the
 *   contents of the vio->obuf are moved to the end the vio->ebuf, possibly
 *   with other diagnostic information.
 *
 * For I/O errors:
 *
 *   The contents of vio->obuf are left untouched -- the closing of the
 *   stack will do what it can with those.
 *
 *   The vio->ebuf will already contain the required error message(s).  The
 *   vio->err_depth will have been set to close as far as vin_base/vout_base,
 *   or to close the vty completely.
 *
 * Deals with:
 *
 *   CMD_WARNING            command: generally failed or not fully succeeded
 *   CMD_ERROR              command: definitely failed
 *
 *   CMD_ERR_PARSING        parser:  general parser error
 *   CMD_ERR_NO_MATCH       parser:  command/argument not recognised
 *   CMD_ERR_AMBIGUOUS      parser:  more than on command matches
 *   CMD_ERR_INCOMPLETE
 *
 *   CMD_IO_ERROR           I/O:     error or time-out -- we expect a
 *                                   diagnostic has already been posted to
 *                                   the ebuf -- but if that is empty, we
 *                                   insert a place-holder.
 *
 * Returns:  target depth = 1 or 0
 *
 * NB: does not expect to see all the possible CMD_XXX return codes (see
 *     below), but treats all as a form of error !
 *
 * NB: can be called in any thread.
