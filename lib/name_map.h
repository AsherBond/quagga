 * Name table definitions
 *
 * A name table maps an integer value to a name, with an option default for
 * unknown values.
 *
 * Two forms of name table are supported:
 *
 *   * direct   -- where the names are in an array indexed directly by value
 *
 *   * indirect -- where the name has to be searched for
 *
 * Obviously, direct is more efficient, except where the value range is large,
 * or very sparse.

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Direct name table
 *
 * This comes in two parts, the "body", which is an array of pointers, and the
 * "map", which points at the body and also contains the default (if any) and
 * the number of entries in the body.
 *
 * The body may be constructed as any other array, for example:
 *
 *   const char* bgp_message_types_body[] =
 *   {
 *     [BGP_MT_OPEN]   = "OPEN",
 *     [BGP_MT_UPDATE] = "UPDATE",
 *     ...
 *   } ;
 *
 * NB: this means that any unspecified values will map to NULL.  Which implies
 *     that it is not possible to map to NULL, because that will map to the
 *     default !
 *
 * The map is most easily constructed using the direct_map macro, for example:
 *
 *   const map_direct_t bgp_message_types_map direct_map =
 *                         map_direct_s(bgp_message_types_body, "UNKNOWN(%d)") ;
 *
 * The map_direct function returns a name_str_t struct, with a .str entry,
 * so can be used:
 *
 *   fprintf("...BGP %s message...", ...,
 *                     map_direct(bgp_message_types_map, val).str, ...) ;
 *
 * If the val is not known, map_direct() will return the default which is
 * assumed to be a format string for sprintf(), with val as the only value
 * parameter.  If the map has no explicit default (NULL is given to the
 * direct_map() macro) then an empty string is returned !
 *
 * To allow for value ranges that include -ve numbers or start with large
 * values, a "min-value" may be specified.  So that:
 *
 *   const char* const foo_body[] =
 *   {
 *     [foo_val_a - foo_min]   = "A",
 *     [foo_val_b - foo_min]   = "B",
 *     ...
 *   } ;
 *
 *   const map_direct_t foo_map direct_map =
 *                          map_direct_min_s(foo_body, "UNKNOWN(%d)", foo_min) ;
 *
 * will work.
