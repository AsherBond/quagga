/* Heaps are implemented as a structure which includes a vector structure.
 * So items in the heap are items in a vector, which are pointers to the item
 * values.
 *
 * The heap structure may be statically allocated, embedded in another
 * structure, or allocated dynamically.  In any case the heap operations
 * require the address of the heap structure -- see typedef for heap.
 *
 * An essential component of a heap is its comparison function.  So, a heap
 * CANNOT be used before it has been initialised and the comparison function
 * set.  (This is unlike a vector, which may be implicitly initialised empty by
 * zeroising the vector structure.)
 *
 * Items may be pushed onto or popped off the heap, which is organised so that
 * the top item has the smallest value -- according to the heap's comparison
 * function.  (For equal values, the order is undefined.)
 *
 * The top item in the heap may be examined, and its value may be updated.
 * (Updating the top item is more efficient than popping and then pushing it.)
 *
 * Items may be deleted from the heap.  Items may have their value updated
 * while they are in the heap.  Both of these operations cause the heap to be
 * reorganised to maintain the heap's partial ordering.  Note: these operations
 * require knowledge of where in the heap the item is -- which, by default, is
 * done by a linear scan of the heap.  For large heaps, there is the option to
 * keep a "backlink" from the item to it's heap position.
 *
 * Vectors may be pushed onto a heap -- copying or moving the contents.
 *
 * Heaps may popped to a vector -- copying or moving the contents.  The
 * resulting vector is fully sorted.
 *
 * ----------------------------
 * Comparison function for heap.
 *
 *   int heap_cmp(...** a, ...** b) ...
 *
 * Must return -1, 0, +1 : where -1 => a < b, 0 => a == b & +1 => a > b
 *
 * Heap will sort "smallest" to the top.  If you want the biggest at the top,
 * return -1 * usual comparison.  Note that the effective heap ordering for
 * equal values is, essentially, random.
 *
 * NB: like other comparison functions (cf qsort) the parameters are pointers
 *     to pointers to the value.
 *
 * NB: there should never be NULL items in the heap.

/* Initialize heap -- allocating heap structure if required.
 *
 * Does not allocate the underlying vector if the heap is initialised empty.
 *
 * eg:
 *
 *  ... = heap_new_init_simple(NULL, 0, (heap_cmp*)my_cmp)
 *
 * See:  #define heap_init_new_simple(h, size, cmp)
 *       #define heap_init_new_backlinked(h, size, cmp, offset)
 *
 * NB: when initialising an existing heap structure it is ESSENTIAL that
 *     any previous heap and its contents have been released, because this
 *     function simply discards whatever was there before.  (This function may
 *     be called to initialise a heap structure which has never been
 *     initialised.)
 *
 * Backlink:
 *
 *   The heap_delete_item and heap_update_item functions need the heap
 *   position of the item.  The default way of finding that is to scan the
 *   underlying heap array, looking for the address of the item.
 *
 *   If either of these functions is done often and on large heaps, it is
 *   possible to speed this up by implementing a 'backlink'.  This requires
 *   a field of type heap_backlink_t in the item structure, and it is the
 *   offset of that which must be initialised here, eg:
 *
 *     ... = heap_new_init_backlinked(NULL, 0, (heap_cmp*)my_cmp,
 *     				offset_of(struct xxx_heap_item, backlink)) ;
 *
 *   This adds a little extra work to every change in the heap -- keeping the
 *   backlink of any moved item up to date.  But avoids a linear search for
 *   every heap_delete_item or heap_update_item.
 *
 * Returns the heap which has been initialised.
